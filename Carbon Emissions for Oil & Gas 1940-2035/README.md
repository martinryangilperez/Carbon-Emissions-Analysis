# Carbon Emissions Analysis for Oil & Gas (1940–2035)

## Product Overview

### Vision
To empower climate-conscious stakeholders with transparent insights into historical and future oil & gas carbon emissions, enabling more informed decisions for environmental impact and policy development.

### Mission
To create a reproducible, data-driven tool that visualizes and analyzes emissions data from 1940 to 2035 — identifying top emitters, emission trends, and opportunities for intervention in the oil & gas sector.

### Strategy
- Use publicly available datasets to analyze emissions patterns over time.
- Visualize trends clearly using Python and data visualization libraries.
- Structure the project with a product-thinking mindset (vision, PRD, user stories, iteration).
- Allow for future integration with machine learning models and scenario testing.

## 📊 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Goals
- Analyze oil & gas CO₂ emissions from 1940 to 2035.
- Identify top-emitting countries and companies over time.
- Visualize emission trends and anomalies.

### User Stories
- **As a policymaker**, I want to track emissions across decades to design better carbon legislation.
- **As a sustainability analyst**, I want to compare emissions by company to inform ESG decisions.
- **As a student or researcher**, I want clear visualizations to understand how fossil fuel emissions evolved.

### Features
- Time series analysis of global and regional CO₂ emissions.
- Bar charts comparing emissions between companies or regions.
- Initial prediction extension to 2035 based on available historical trends.
- Highlighting the “worst offenders” in each category.
