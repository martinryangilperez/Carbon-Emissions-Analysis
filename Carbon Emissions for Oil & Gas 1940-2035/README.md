# Carbon Emissions Analysis for Oil & Gas (1940–2035)

## Product Overview

### Vision
To empower climate-conscious stakeholders with transparent insights into historical and future oil & gas carbon emissions, enabling more informed decisions for environmental impact and policy development.

### Mission
To create a reproducible, data-driven tool that visualizes and analyzes emissions data from 1940 to 2035 — identifying top emitters, emission trends, and opportunities for intervention in the oil & gas sector.

### Strategy
- Use publicly available datasets to analyze emissions patterns over time.
- Visualize trends clearly using Python and data visualization libraries.
- Structure the project with a product-thinking mindset (vision, PRD, user stories, iteration).
- Allow for future integration with machine learning models and scenario testing.

## Technologies Used
